<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Lavanya, a first-year student at BITS Pilani, currently learning web development. I started coding recently and am loving how websites come together through simple HTML and CSS.

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>I began with basic HTML and slowly moved into CSS and JavaScript. I'm learning from Udemy and enjoying every step of it.</p>

<h2>Why I love Web Development</h2>
<p>It allows me to bring my creativity into the browser! Seeing a blank page turn into something meaningful is exciting.</p>

<h2>Other Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Swimming & Badminton</li>
  <li>Reading about Finance & Investing</li>
  <li>Listening to music and watching anime</li>
</ul>
